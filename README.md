DeepViNE, a DRL-based VNE solution automates the selection of necessary problem features for the DRL approach. The approach involves encoding physical and virtual networks as two-dimensional images, allowing a convolutional deep neural network to interpret them. Additionally, there is a strategy to reduce the number of actions the learning agent needs, ensuring efficient exploration of the solution space without compromising learning speed or convergence.

#To run the project: Download the notebook and run the cells.

#Results: The provided code seems to be a part of an implementation involving virtual and physical network creation, reinforcement learning with Q-learning, and functions to update and manage representations of these networks.The code is incomplete but made for simulating virtual and physical networks, defining nodes with CPU demand, available CPU, and network link bandwidths. Additionally, there is some code of reinforcement learning using Q-learning for network embedding and updating representations based on the embedded virtual nodes.
